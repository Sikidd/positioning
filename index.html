       <p>This is my Portal page where I will be posting my projects and other useful information.</p>
       
       <p>I am Jose Alejandre, I have been working since I was in middle school in many uninspiring jobs so I decided to take the first steps to becoming a proffesional in something that I enjoy. I started the <a href="https://www.yearup.org/" target="_blank">Year Up</a> program where I aim to land an internship that can give me tech/coding experience. So far I love the program and I am having fun coding and tweaking webpages and I am eager to see how far I can take myself in the tech industry. Hopefully in the future I will have a lot of experience and get a permanent place in the tech industry where I can work from home and sustain a family. </p>
       
       <p>I have a few goals that include having a big house with a 10+ car garage because I love cars but don't have the money for them just yet. I also go to the gym consistently so I can get as strong as Goku (the character in the picture). In the far future I also want to start a family where I can have kids and help them achieve their dreams, whatever they may be. These are high ambitions but I know I can achieve them because I am putting in the work now and they are things that I am passionate about.</p>
